# rdf-calendar
Javascript HTML library for calendar from RDF data

The targeted Web component (currently) is
https://www.webcomponents.org/element/onuridrisoglu/calendar-component

The principle, like the geography component of Semantic_Forms, is to take all the temporal stuff in the triples and display that at best.
Therefore it will not be based on RDF properties like the RDF geography component https://github.com/jmvanel/rdf-geo-map, but on typed literals xsd:date, xsd:dateTime .

I will not do the Web Component packaging, because I can not do it, and that functionally it is not essential.
